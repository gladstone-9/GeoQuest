### Getting Started

Setting up a Virtual Environment: 
1. __Install the Virtual Environment Package__: If the ```venv``` module isn't imported for your current environment enter ```python -m pip install --user virtualenv``` into the terminal

2. __Creating the Virtual Environment:__ To create the environment enter ```python -m venv env``` into the console where ```env``` will be the name of the virtual environment.

3. __Activate the Environment:__ Add the environment's executable to the shell path by typing ```.\env\Scripts\activate``` for Windows or ```source env/bin/activate``` for macOS/Linux

4. __Install Required Packages__: If the environment doesn't currently have all the modules that this project uses imported, they can be added with ```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

5. __Verify Django Installation__: Check that Django has been installed into the virtual environment with ```python -m django --version```

6. __Deactivating the environment:__ When you want to exit the virtual environment simply type ```deactivate```
